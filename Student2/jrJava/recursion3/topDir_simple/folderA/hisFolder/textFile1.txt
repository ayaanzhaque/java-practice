JULIET

    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO

    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET

    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO

    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
    Give me my sin again.

JULIET

    You kiss by the book.

Nurse

    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO

    What is her mother?

Nurse

    Marry, bachelor,
    Her mother is the lady of the house,
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO

    Is she a Capulet?
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO

    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
