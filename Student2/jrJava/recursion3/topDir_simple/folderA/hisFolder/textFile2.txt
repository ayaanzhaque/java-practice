     Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
    I'll to my rest.

    Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

JULIET

    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse

    The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET

    What's he that now is going out of door?

Nurse

    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET

    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse

    I know not.

JULIET

    Go ask his name: if he be married.
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse

    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
    The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET

    My only love sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
