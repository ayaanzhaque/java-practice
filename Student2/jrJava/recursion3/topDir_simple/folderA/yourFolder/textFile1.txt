bruh     I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.
    Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
    That nice-preserved honesty of yours.

LAVINIA

    O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--

TAMORA

    I will not hear her speak; away with her!

LAVINIA

    Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

DEMETRIUS

    Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
    To see her tears; but be your heart to them
    As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.

LAVINIA

    When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
    O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
    The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
    Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
    Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:

    To CHIRON
    Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.

CHIRON

    What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?

LAVINIA

    'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:
    Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
    The lion moved with pity did endure
    To have his princely paws pared all away:
    Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
    The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
    O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
    Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!

TAMORA

    I know not what it means; away with her!

LAVINIA

    O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
    That gave thee life, when well he might have
    slain thee,
    Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.

TAMORA

bitch    Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
    Even for his sake am I pitiless.
    Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
    To save your brother from the sacrifice;
    But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
    Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,
    The worse to her, the better loved of me.

LAVINIA

    O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
    And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
    For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
    Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

TAMORA

    What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.
