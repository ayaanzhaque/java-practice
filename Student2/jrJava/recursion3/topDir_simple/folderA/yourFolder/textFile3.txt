MARTIUS

    The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
    Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
    To find thy brother Bassianus dead.

SATURNINUS

    My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
    He and his lady both are at the lodge
    Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
    'Tis not an hour since I left him there.

MARTIUS

    We know not where you left him all alive;
    But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.

    Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants; TITUS ANDRONICUS, and Lucius

TAMORA

    Where is my lord the king?

SATURNINUS

    Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.

TAMORA

    Where is thy brother Bassianus?

SATURNINUS

    Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
    Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

TAMORA

    Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
    The complot of this timeless tragedy;
    And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
    In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.

    She giveth SATURNINUS a letter

SATURNINUS

    [Reads] 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
    Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
    Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
    Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
    Among the nettles at the elder-tree
    Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
    Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
    Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
    O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
    This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
    Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
    That should have murdered Bassianus here.

AARON

    My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

SATURNINUS

    [To TITUS] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of
    bloody kind,
    Have here bereft my brother of his life.
    Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
    There let them bide until we have devised
    Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.

TAMORA

    What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
    How easily murder is discovered!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    High emperor, upon my feeble knee
    I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
    That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
    Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--

SATURNINUS

    If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
    Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?

TAMORA

    Andronicus himself did take it up.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
    For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
    They shall be ready at your highness' will
    To answer their suspicion with their lives.

SATURNINUS

    Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
    Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:
    Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
    For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
    That end upon them should be executed.

TAMORA

    Andronicus, I will entreat the king;
    Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
