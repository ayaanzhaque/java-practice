     Be absolute for death; either death or life
    Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
    If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
    That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
    Servile to all the skyey influences,
    That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
    Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
    For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
    And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
    For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
    Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
    For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
    Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
    And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
    Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
    For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
    That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
    For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
    And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
    For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
    After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
    Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
    And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
    For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
    The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
    Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
    For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
    But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
    Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
    Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
    Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
    Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
    To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
    That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
    Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
    That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO

    I humbly thank you.
    To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
    And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA

    [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!

Provost

    Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO

    Most holy sir, I thank you.

    Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA

    My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost

    And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Provost, a word with you.

Provost

    As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

    Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost

CLAUDIO

    Now, sister, what's the comfort?

ISABELLA

    Why,
    As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
    Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
    Intends you for his swift ambassador,
    Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
    Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
    To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO

    Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA

    None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
    To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO

    But is there any?

ISABELLA

    Yes, brother, you may live:
    There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
    If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
    But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO

    Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA

    Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
    Though all the world's vastidity you had,
    To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO

    But in what nature?

ISABELLA

    In such a one as, you consenting to't,
    Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
    And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO

    Let me know the point.

ISABELLA

    O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
    Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
    And six or seven winters more respect
    Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
    The sense of death is most in apprehension;
    And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
    In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
    As when a giant dies.
