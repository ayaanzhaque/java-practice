Servant

    He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
    I'll tell him of you.

Provost

    Pray you, do.

    Exit Servant
    I'll know
    His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
    He hath but as offended in a dream!
    All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
    To die for't!

    Enter ANGELO

ANGELO

    Now, what's the matter. Provost?

Provost

    Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO

    Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
    Why dost thou ask again?

Provost

    Lest I might be too rash:
    Under your good correction, I have seen,
    When, after execution, judgment hath
    Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO

    Go to; let that be mine:
    Do you your office, or give up your place,
    And you shall well be spared.

Provost

    I crave your honour's pardon.
    What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
    She's very near her hour.

ANGELO

    Dispose of her
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

    Re-enter Servant

Servant

    Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
    Desires access to you.

ANGELO

    Hath he a sister?

Provost

    Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
    And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
    If not already.

ANGELO

    Well, let her be admitted.

    Exit Servant
    See you the fornicatress be removed:
    Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
    There shall be order for't.

    Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO

Provost

    God save your honour!

ANGELO

    Stay a little while.

    To ISABELLA
    You're welcome: what's your will?

ISABELLA

    I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
    Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO

    Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA

    There is a vice that most I do abhor,
    And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
    For which I would not plead, but that I must;
    For which I must not plead, but that I am
    At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO

    Well; the matter?

ISABELLA

    I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
    I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
    And not my brother.

Provost

    [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!

ANGELO

    Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
    Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
    Mine were the very cipher of a function,
    To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
    And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA

    O just but severe law!
    I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to him
    again, entreat him;
    Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
    You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
    You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
    To him, I say!

ISABELLA

    Must he needs die?

ANGELO

    Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA

    Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
    And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO

    I will not do't.

ISABELLA

    But can you, if you would?

ANGELO

    Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA

    But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
    If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
    A s mine is to him?

ANGELO

    He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.

ISABELLA

    Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
    May call it back again. Well, believe this,
    No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
    Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
    The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
    Become them with one half so good a grace
    As mercy does.
    If he had been as you and you as he,
    You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
    Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO

    Pray you, be gone.

ISABELLA

    I would to heaven I had your potency,
    And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
    No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
    And what a prisoner.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA]
    Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

ANGELO

    Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
    And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA

    Alas, alas!
    Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
    And He that might the vantage best have took
    Found out the remedy. How would you be,
    If He, which is the top of judgment, should
    But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
    And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
    Like man new made.

ANGELO

    Be you content, fair maid;
    It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
    Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
    It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA

    To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
    He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
    We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
    With less respect than we do minister
    To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
    Who is it that hath died for this offence?
    There's many have committed it.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.

ANGELO

    The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
    Those many had not dared to do that evil,
    If the first that did the edict infringe
    Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
    Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
    Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
    Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
    And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
    Are now to have no successive degrees,
    But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA

    Yet show some pity.

ANGELO

    I show it most of all when I show justice;
    For then I pity those I do not know,
    Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
    And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
    Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
    Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA

    So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
    And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
    To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
    To use it like a giant.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.

ISABELLA

    Could great men thunder
    As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
    For every pelting, petty officer
    Would use his heaven for thunder;
    Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
    Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
    Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
    Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
    Drest in a little brief authority,
    Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
    As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
    Would all themselves laugh mortal.
