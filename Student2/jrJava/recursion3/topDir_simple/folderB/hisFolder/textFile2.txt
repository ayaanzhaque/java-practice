ANGELO

    We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
    Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
    And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
    Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS

    Ay, but yet
    Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
    Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
    Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
    Let but your honour know,
    Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
    That, in the working of your own affections,
    Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
    Or that the resolute acting of your blood
    Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
    Whether you had not sometime in your life
    Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
    And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO

    'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
    Another thing to fall. I not deny,
    The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
    May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
    Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
    That justice seizes: what know the laws
    That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
    The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
    Because we see it; but what we do not see
    We tread upon, and never think of it.
    You may not so extenuate his offence
    For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
    When I, that censure him, do so offend,
    Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
    And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS

    Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO

    Where is the provost?

Provost

    Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO

    See that Claudio
    Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
    Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
    For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

    Exit Provost

ESCALUS

    [Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
    Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
    Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
    And some condemned for a fault alone.

    Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY

ELBOW

    Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
    a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
    common houses, I know no law: bring them away.

ANGELO

    How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW

    If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
    constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
    justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
    honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO

    Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
    they not malefactors?

ELBOW

    If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
    are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
    of; and void of all profanation in the world that
    good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS

    This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO

    Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
    name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY

    He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO

    What are you, sir?

ELBOW

    He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
    serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
    say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
    professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS

    How know you that?

ELBOW

    My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS

    How? thy wife?

ELBOW

    Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS

    Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW

    I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
    she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
    it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS

    How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW

    Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
    cardinally given, might have been accused in
    fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS

    By the woman's means?

ELBOW

    Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
    spit in his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY

    Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW

    Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
    man; prove it.

ESCALUS

    Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY

    Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
    saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
    sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
    distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
    dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
    such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
    good dishes,--
