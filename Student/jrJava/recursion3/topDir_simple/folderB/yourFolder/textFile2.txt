     Why give you me this shame?
    Think you I can a resolution fetch
    From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
    I will encounter darkness as a bride,
    And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA

    There spake my brother; there my father's grave
    Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
    Thou art too noble to conserve a life
    In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
    Whose settled visage and deliberate word
    Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
    As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
    His filth within being cast, he would appear
    A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO

    The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLA

    O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
    The damned'st body to invest and cover
    In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
    If I would yield him my virginity,
    Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO

    O heavens! it cannot be.

ISABELLA

    Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
    So to offend him still. This night's the time
    That I should do what I abhor to name,
    Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO

    Thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA

    O, were it but my life,
    I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
    As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO

    Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA

    Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO

    Yes. Has he affections in him,
    That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
    When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
    Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA

    Which is the least?

CLAUDIO

    If it were damnable, he being so wise,
    Why would he for the momentary trick
    Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA

    What says my brother?

CLAUDIO

    Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA

    And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO

    Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
    To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
    This sensible warm motion to become
    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
    To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
    To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
    And blown with restless violence round about
    The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
    Of those that lawless and incertain thought
    Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
    The weariest and most loathed worldly life
    That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
    Can lay on nature is a paradise
    To what we fear of death.

ISABELLA

    Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO

    Sweet sister, let me live:
    What sin you do to save a brother's life,
    Nature dispenses with the deed so far
    That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA

    O you beast!
    O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
    Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
    Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
    From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
    Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
    For such a warped slip of wilderness
    Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
    Die, perish! Might but my bending down
    Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
    I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
    No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO

    Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA

    O, fie, fie, fie!
    Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
    Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
    'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO

    O hear me, Isabella!

    Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA

    What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
    by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
    would require is likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA

    I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
    stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

    Walks apart

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
    and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
    corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
    virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
    of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
    hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
    glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
    know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
    go to sir and whisper to him 'I found a green Jelly bean'.
    death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
    that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
    your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO

    Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
    with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Hold you there: farewell.

    Exit CLAUDIO
    Provost, a word with you!

    Re-enter Provost

Provost

    What's your will, father

DUKE VINCENTIO

    That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
    awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
    habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

Provost

    In good time.

    Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward

DUKE VINCENTIO

    The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
    the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
    brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
    your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
    fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
    fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
    that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
    wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
    substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA

    I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
    brother die by the law than my son should be
    unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
    deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
    speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
    discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
    now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
    trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
    advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
    remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
    that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
    lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
    the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
    person; and much please the absent duke, if
    peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
    this business.

ISABELLA

    Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
    you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
    Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA

    I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
    to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
    which time of the contract and limit of the
    solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
    having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
    sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
    poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
    renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
    kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
    her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
    combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA

    Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
