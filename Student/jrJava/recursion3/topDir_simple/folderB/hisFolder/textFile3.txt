ESCALUS

    Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY

    No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
    the right: but to the point. As I say, this
    Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
    being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
    prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
    Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
    rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
    honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
    not give you three-pence again.

FROTH

    No, indeed.

POMPEY

    Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
    cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH

    Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY

    Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
    remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
    cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
    good diet, as I told you,--

FROTH

    All this is true.

POMPEY

    Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS

    Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
    was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
    complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY

    Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS

    No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY

    Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
    leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
    here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
    father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
    Master Froth?

FROTH

    All-hallond eve.

POMPEY

    Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
    sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
    the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
    to sit, have you not?

FROTH

    I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY

    Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO

    This will last out a night in Russia,
    When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
    And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
    Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS

    I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.

    Exit ANGELO
    Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY

    Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW

    I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY

    I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS

    Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY

    I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
    Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
    good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS

    Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY

    Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS

    Well, I do so.

POMPEY

    Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS

    Why, no.

POMPEY

    I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
    thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
    worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
    constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
    your honour.

ESCALUS

    He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW

    First, an it like you, the house is a respected
    house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
    mistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY

    By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
    person than any of us all.

ELBOW

    Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
    time has yet to come that she was ever respected
    with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY

    Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS

    Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
    this true?

ELBOW

    O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
    Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
    to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
    with me, let not your worship think me the poor
    duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
    I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS

    If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
    action of slander too.

ELBOW

    Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
    your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS

    Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
    that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
    continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
    are.

ELBOW

    Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
    wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
    to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS

    Where were you born, friend?

FROTH

    Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS

    Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH

    Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS

    So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY

    Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS

    Your mistress' name?

POMPHEY

    Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS

    Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY

    Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS

    Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
    Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
    tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
    will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
    more of you.

FROTH

    I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
    come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
    in.

ESCALUS

    Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.

    Exit FROTH
    Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
    name, Master tapster?
