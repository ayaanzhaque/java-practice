LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! he
    will relent;
    He's coming; I perceive 't.

Provost

    [Aside] Pray heaven she win him!

ISABELLA

    We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
    Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
    But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO

    Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA

    That in the captain's but a choleric word,
    Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.

ANGELO

    Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA

    Because authority, though it err like others,
    Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
    That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
    Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
    That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
    A natural guiltiness such as is his,
    Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
    Against my brother's life.

ANGELO

    [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
    Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.

ISABELLA

    Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO

    I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA

    Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO

    How! bribe me?

ISABELLA

    Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.

ISABELLA

    Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
    Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
    As fancy values them; but with true prayers
    That shall be up at heaven and enter there
    Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
    From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
    To nothing temporal.

ANGELO

    Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away!

ISABELLA

    Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO

    [Aside] Amen:
    For I am that way going to temptation,
    Where prayers cross.

ISABELLA

    At what hour to-morrow
    Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO

    At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA

    'Save your honour!

    Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost

ANGELO

    From thee, even from thy virtue!
    What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
    The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
    Ha!
    Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
    That, lying by the violet in the sun,
    Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
    Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
    That modesty may more betray our sense
    Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
    Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
    And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
    What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
    Dost thou desire her foully for those things
    That make her good? O, let her brother live!
    Thieves for their robbery have authority
    When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
    That I desire to hear her speak again,
    And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
    O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
    With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
    Is that temptation that doth goad us on
    To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
    With all her double vigour, art and nature,
    Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
    Subdues me quite. Even till now,
    When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
